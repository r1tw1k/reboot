curis - the healthcare assistant

Nowadays in our busy life we are not able to spend time with our elders and take care of them,but this is the time when one needs help in day to day activity and one needs someone around to help them out,hence we need some kind of a device that can help us monitor elders and also alert us when they are in danger or need our help.

Our Team aims to build a smart wearable device for the elderly that can help them stay safe and healthy

Hence we plan to make a smart watch with the following features :

1) Alert the caretakers or close ones, if the elderly falls down suddenly or slips
2) If the elderly is having some medical emergency he/she can immeidately infrom the close ones by pressing the panic button on the watch
3) The watch will also remind the elderly to take medicines on time
4) Display the time and weather(Its a watch after all !!)
5) It will be portable and easy to use with minimum cost.

These are just some of the features that the watch will initially include, with little funding and a little help we can even track the
1)	live location of the elderly, 
2)	get infromed about the irregular heartbeats and decreasing blood pressure.
3)	 also link the watch with personal assistants such as Alexa or google assistant for better user experience.

Our watch would consist of the following :
1) a Micro-controller board to control all the ouput and input devices
2) display, to display all the informtaion
3) wifi module to connect the watch to the internet
4) button and buzzer

We hope that our smat watch idea will be able to help the senior citizens by making their lives easier.
